      <description>I recently fasted for 3 days, and it was really hard. From 7:40 PM on 12/18/20 through 7:40 PM on Monday, 12/21/20, I did not eat anything. The only nutrients I consumed were water, black coffee, salt, and lemon juice. This post is a log of my thoughts and feelings I had throughout the 3 days.
  12/18/20 at 7:40 PM: I finished my last meal, which was notably carb heavy.</description>

      <description>Earlier today, I performed my first ring muscle-up. Finally achieving this movement is a huge accomplishment for meâ€“it only took 4.5 months of training, countless YouTube videos, many failed attempts, and several reddit posts to finally get. The ring muscle-up is an advanced calisthenics move in which you grip a pair of gymnastics rings with a false grip, perform a pull-up, transition into the lower part of a dip, and then press yourself up.</description>
