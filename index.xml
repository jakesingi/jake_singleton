You&amp;rsquo;re a career 71% successful base stealer, and Kershaw&amp;rsquo;s back is to you as he brings his hands together above his head as he comes set. Do you steal home?</description>

      <description>Earlier today, I performed my first ring muscle-up. Finally achieving this movement is a huge accomplishment for meâ€“it only took 4.5 months of training, countless YouTube videos, many failed attempts, and several reddit posts to finally get. The ring muscle-up is an advanced calisthenics move in which you grip a pair of gymnastics rings with a false grip, perform a pull-up, transition into the lower part of a dip, and then press yourself up.</description>
