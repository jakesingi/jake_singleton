      <description>In this project, I create 2020 NFL rankings based on the method described in Mathletics by Wayne Winston. I do so by scraping NFL game data in Python and creating team ratings using Microsoft Excel&amp;rsquo;s Solver tool. The relevant Python code and Excel files are all included in the GitHub Repo so that the reader may play around with the ratings if they like. The code is also thoroughly commented so that he/she may change things around as appropriate, and the Excel formulas are all pretty straightforward.</description>

      <description>I recently fasted for 3 days, and it was really hard. From 7:40 PM on 12/18/20 through 7:40 PM on Monday, 12/21/20, I did not eat anything. The only nutrients I consumed were water, black coffee, salt, and lemon juice. This post is a log of my thoughts and feelings I had throughout the 3 days.
  12/18/20 at 7:40 PM: I finished my last meal, which was notably carb heavy.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s World Series Game 5 with the series tied at 2. You&amp;rsquo;re standing on third with a teammate on first, you&amp;rsquo;re down by 1 in the bottom of the 4th with 2 outs, and future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw is on the mound. You&amp;rsquo;re a career 71% successful base stealer, and Kershaw&amp;rsquo;s back is to you as he brings his hands together above his head as he comes set. Do you steal home?</description>

      <title>Fitness: Ring Muscle-Up</title>
      <link>https://jakesingi.github.io/jake_singleton/blog/muscle_up/</link>

      <description>Earlier today, I performed my first ring muscle-up. Finally achieving this movement is a huge accomplishment for meâ€“it only took 4.5 months of training, countless YouTube videos, many failed attempts, and several reddit posts to finally get. The ring muscle-up is an advanced calisthenics move in which you grip a pair of gymnastics rings with a false grip, perform a pull-up, transition into the lower part of a dip, and then press yourself up.</description>
